        <h3> <strong>Effects of COVID-19-Related School Closures on Student Achievement-A Systematic Review</strong></h3>
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic led to numerous governments deciding to close schools for several weeks in spring 2020. Empirical evidence on the impact of COVID-19-related school closures on academic achievement is only just emerging. The present work aimed to provide a first systematic overview of evidence-based studies on general and differential effects of COVID-19-related school closures in spring 2020 on student achievement in primary and secondary education. Results indicate a negative effect of school closures on student achievement, specifically in younger students and students from families with low socioeconomic status.</p>

        <h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
        <p>
            In spring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused severe disruption to everyday life around the world. As one of several measures taken to prevent the spread of the virus, many governments closed schools for several weeks or months. Although school closures are considered to be one of the most efficient interventions to curb the spread of the virus (Haug et al., 2020), many educators and researchers raised concerns about the effects of COVID-19-related school closures on student academic achievement and learning inequalities.</p>
